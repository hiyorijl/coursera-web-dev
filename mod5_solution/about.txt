The code provided is written in JavaScript and contains functions that retrieve and manipulate data to build an HTML page.

The code starts by adding an event listener to the document object that listens for the DOMContentLoaded event, which is triggered when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed. Inside this event listener, the showLoading function is called to show a loading icon inside the element identified by the selector "#main-content". Then, the sendGetRequest function is called from the $ajaxUtils object to send an HTTP GET request to the URL specified in the variable "allCategoriesUrl" to retrieve a JSON object containing a list of categories. This request is asynchronous and the buildAndShowHomeHTML function is specified as the callback function to be executed when the response is received. Finally, the "true" parameter is passed to indicate that the server response should be processed as JSON.

The buildAndShowHomeHTML function is called when the response is received from the server. This function first sends an HTTP GET request to retrieve the HTML snippet for the home page from the URL specified in the variable "homeHtmlUrl". This request is also asynchronous and a callback function is specified to handle the response. Inside this callback function, the chooseRandomCategory function is called with the categories object as the argument. The chooseRandomCategory function randomly selects a category from the categories list and returns the selected category object. The chosen category short name is then inserted into the homeHtml snippet using the insertProperty function. The resulting HTML snippet is then inserted into the main page using the insertHtml function.

The code also defines a few helper functions such as insertProperty, insertHtml, and showLoading. These functions are used to insert HTML snippets into the main page and show a loading icon while the data is being retrieved. The code also contains a few variables that contain the URLs of the data sources and HTML snippets. Additionally, the code contains an event listener for the blur event on the #navbarToggle element that hides the collapsible navbar if the screen width is less than 768 pixels.
